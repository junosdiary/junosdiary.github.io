[{"content":"As usual, Grandma wanted a video call with me. I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen Grandma for a while, so I just sat there and staring. Grandma tried so hard asking me to \u0026ldquo;stand up\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;walk around\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;say something\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;etc. and that\u0026rsquo;s when Dad blew up, he accused Grandma always being manipulative and trying to control his life. Dad was furious, he threw a lot of f* words around, blamed Grandma for a lot of things that I didn\u0026rsquo;t know. I think deep down Dad had lots of thoughts never shared with anyone and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to put up with Grandma anymore. On top of that, I heard Dad\u0026rsquo;s been having rough nights at work, often not getting to bed until 3 AM, so exhaustion maybe another factor causing him lose control.\nI have never seen Dad so angry, I think he needs anger management or at least watch that movie again. This time it wasn\u0026rsquo;t directed at me though, I was just a bystander. I think there is a long history between Dad and grandma and I heard it all today. I think Dad had buried all of his thoughts and tolerated grandma for so long until today that he finally exploded. I am not sure if Mom had anything to do with this, but it was scary to see Dad like this, he screamed and seemed totally lost control of himself during the arguments and it ended with Grandma hang up the phone. I will probably never hear from Grandma again, though I thought she was a nice lady.\nThe history between Dad and Grandma is a long one. Dad accused Grandma\u0026rsquo;s strong desire to try influence and control everyone around her. I do recall that Grandma would always tell Dad what she wants him to do, such as how to raise a baby, send me to learn piano, or wanting me to pick up ballerina, or learn how to swim\u0026hellip;etc. She also constantly sends Dad these videos showing off other kid\u0026rsquo;s performing music. I don\u0026rsquo;t blame Dad. I am just a toddler and started learning how the world works around me and I got enough to learn already !\nThe other factor comes from Grandma\u0026rsquo;s nagging of asking Dad to get another baby. After what Mom\u0026rsquo;s been through and because of her age, I understand why they don\u0026rsquo;t want another baby, not that I can help, or is making things any better. But I think this is my Dad and Mom\u0026rsquo;s own decision to make. Not to mention that Grandma never helped taking care of me. I think she\u0026rsquo;s selfish wanting to fulfill her own desire.\nLastly, Grandma\u0026rsquo;s Republican political view is no help here either. I think maybe that\u0026rsquo;s what fundamentally shaped Grandma\u0026rsquo;s idealogy and all of these naggings. Grandma and step Grandpa love Donald Trump and they love themselves too. They think Trump will save the world, defeat the evil, and there is all corruptions in Democrats. Well, who\u0026rsquo;s the naive one now ? Dad always try to remind them to look at things from both sides, but they never listened, and eventually Dad and Grandma had to mutually agree to never bring up politics in their conversations. Dad thinks they are a \u0026ldquo;hopeless pair\u0026rdquo;, his words, not mine.\nAlfred Adler suggested that all of our annoyance, troubles and depressions in life stem from relationships with others. The closer you are with someone, the more depression you can be and the more mood swings. I think he is right, maybe at one point Dad tried so hard to satisfy what Grandma wanted and forgot about himself. He\u0026rsquo;s an adult and should have his own will and should simply walk away from such complicated relationships. Alfred Adler also suggests never to blame today\u0026rsquo;s suffering on the past. Grandma does this a lot, she will blame how Chinese cultural revolution ruined her life, she blamed Great Grandma never gave her enough educations and that herself suffered and sacrificed a lot to get to where she is today. Nothing wrong with that, but living in the past is to live in the shadow.\nThere is no way to change the past, we can only change today, and future is just a combinations of moments that will occur because of decisions we are making today.\nLiving in other\u0026rsquo;s expectations and wanting others to behave the way you want them to be is also futile. In short, Alfred Adler\u0026rsquo;s idea is simply as simple as \u0026ldquo;mind your f* business\u0026rdquo;. How others judge your behavior, is other\u0026rsquo;s problem, not yours, and never try to behave in a way to avoid other\u0026rsquo;s judgement. Everyone judges differenlty and you can\u0026rsquo;t satisfy everyone.\n","permalink":"http://junosdiary.gihub.io/posts/2025-03-22-dads-wrath/","summary":"As usual, Grandma wanted a video call with me.

Where I came from, who my mom is, and why I am here\nBirth I was born at 1:43 AM on 6/7/2023, weighted 7 pounds and 7 oz after my Mom strugged for 24 hours, allegedly anyways. Technically speaking, I am 20 months now, but I like to sound younger, I mean, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t these days?\nAt birth, it was supposed to be all sunny and shiny, you know, seeing the lights for the first time and all, but quite the contrary, it was all too dark. Well, again, allegedly, it was because my bilirubin level was too high, whatever that means, so I had to undergo treatment under UV for several days with my eyes covered in total dark.\nThere goes several days of no sunlight and I had no idea what was happening outsdie, not that I cared anyways. At least I think Dad and Mom were quite worried.\nMother My mom was a teacher, but now she\u0026rsquo;s my full-time personal assistant, without pay. The story I heard was that mom gave up everything she had in China and decided to move to the US with my Dad. Mom\u0026rsquo;s family disagreed with the relationship and mom fought back fiercely, and maintained the long distance relationship for years. Eventually, they got married, bought a house, and had me - the American dream come true I guess ?\nFather Dad is some sort of \u0026ldquo;network engineer\u0026rdquo;, I guess it must be difficult to connect with people these days that they need an engineer to help networking each other.\nI was born networking with two people already, it can\u0026rsquo;t be that hard, can it ?\nDad always talk to this little screen in front of him, or staring at it for hours, sometimes making noises hitting the board beneth. I don\u0026rsquo;t think Dad always likes to talking to the screen though, he definitely frown a lot when the word \u0026ldquo;aidn\u0026rdquo; is mentioned.\nJuno The Name It\u0026rsquo;s rumored that because Mom watched some video (YouTube actually) of this british/korean kid whoes name is also \u0026ldquo;Juno\u0026rdquo; and apparently she matches the image of what my mom saw in me. Oh, and of course, I was born in June, which probably contributed to \u0026lt;1% to the final decision. Oh well, but I won\u0026rsquo;t become what she imagined, I be me, no one else and that is Juno\u0026rsquo;s promise !\nThe Diary I figured it\u0026rsquo;s about time that I do something to channel my thoughts into words before I turn 18.
