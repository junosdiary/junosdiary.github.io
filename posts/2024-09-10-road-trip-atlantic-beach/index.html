So I decided to cry all night, which is how I always get my way and it worked!

But who cares, the trip was to make me happy anyways\nThe location of the Airbnb room was fantastic. It was just a few walks away from the beach, weather was OK, I think only 1 day was sunny enough to stay by the beach, the other days were either too windy or too raining. Either way, I didn’t care, because it turns out that I don’t like the beach ! I am not a fan of sand, I just don’t like the tingling feelings and I refuse to put my feet on the beach or I start crying immediately !!\nI heard and saw Mom trying to learn swimming; Dad was such a patient teacher, I adore him. They wanted me to learn swimming as well, and it was my first time putting a swim suit. The first day was fine, and watching Mom learning swimming isn’t as bad, after all she’s just as good as me. But 1 day is all I can stand, I refuse watching her learning every day, it’s just a very boring thing to do at the beach !!\nThe last day was great ! We had dinner at Amos Mosquito’s, they had amazing seafood, I enjoyed it there though I forgot what I had, but it was great for sure because I overheard Dad that the total was $100, so it must be good food !\n",
